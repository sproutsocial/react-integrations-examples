# react-integrations-examples

This is a small sample of code to showcase the issues discussed in the [Chicago React.js meetup on January 26](http://www.meetup.com/React-Chicago/events/227874878/). There are two examples in here: the date picker that showcases our re-render everything approach, and the donut chart that shows how that approach doesn't work in every scenario.

Viewing the sample should be as simple as running thse commands then opening `index.html` in your browser.

```
npm i -g babel # don't run if you already have Babel installed globally
npm i
npm run-script build
```

Questions and comments can be put in issues here, or directed at me on twitter (@gordonkristan).
